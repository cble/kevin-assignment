 * 3. Write a java function to print all perfect number between 1 and n.
 * i. Perfect numberÂ is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
 * ii. For example: 6 is the first perfect number, Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

 * Here is the prototype you can work with
 *
